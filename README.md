generateXmlSampleData
=====================

Used to test xml databases and middleware transports.  Not very useful so move on.

this generates a lot of files based on zip code and permits for small businesses.

Useful just to have a large quanity of xml files that can be used for test.

This is my first set of py code so move on. Nothing of interest here@


No need to run fixZ.py since the results are already stored in the repo.
